abstract = {Despite the remarkable evolution of deep neural networks in natural language processing (NLP), their interpretability remains a challenge. Previous work largely focused on what these models learn at the representation level. We break this analysis down further and study individual dimensions (neurons) in the vector representation learned by end-to-end neural models in NLP tasks. We propose two methods: Linguistic Correlation Analysis, based on a supervised method to extract the most relevant neurons with respect to an extrinsic task, and Cross-model Correlation Analysis, an unsupervised method to extract salient neurons w.r.t. the model itself. We evaluate the effectiveness of our techniques by ablating the identified neurons and reevaluating the network's performance for two tasks: neural machine translation (NMT) and neural language modeling (NLM). We further present a comprehensive analysis of neurons with the aim to address the following questions: i) how localized or distributed are different linguistic properties in the models? ii) are certain neurons exclusive to some properties and not others? iii) is the information more or less distributed in NMT vs. NLM? and iv) how important are the neurons identified through the linguistic correlation method to the overall task? Our code is publicly available as part of the NeuroX toolkit (Dalvi et al. 2019a). This paper is a non-archived version of the paper published at AAAI (Dalvi et al. 2019b).},

abstract = {The opacity of deep neural networks remains a challenge in deploying solutions where explanation is as important as precision. We present ConceptX, a human-in-the-loop framework for interpreting and annotating latent representational space in pre-trained Language Models (pLMs). We use an unsupervised method to discover concepts learned in these models and enable a graphical interface for humans to generate explanations for the concepts. To facilitate the process, we provide auto-annotations of the concepts (based on traditional linguistic ontologies). Such annotations enable development of a linguistic resource that directly represents latent concepts learned within deep NLP models. These include not just traditional linguistic concepts, but also task-specific or sensitive concepts (words grouped based on gender or religious connotation) that helps the annotators to mark bias in the model. The framework consists of two parts (i) concept discovery and (ii) annotation platform.},
